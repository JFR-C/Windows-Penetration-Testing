#### STEP 1. BYPASSING NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL (NAC) - if any üîêüï∏üßëüèº‚Äçüíª
<i>If a NAC solution is implemented, the purpose of this phase will be to bypass it to get access to the internal network and start the internal penetration test.</i>
```
1. Pre-connect scenario => NAC checks are made before granting any access to the internal network
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ MAC address spoofing technique
  - Bypass MAC address filtering solution by spoofing the MAC address of a whitelisted device (e.g. printer, smart TV in meeting room, VOIP phone)
‚û§ Pre-authenticated device technique
  - Bypass wired network 802.1x protection (NAC) by placing a rogue device (with 2 network adapters) between a pre-authenticated device and the network switch. 
    Using scripts like 'fenrir-ocd' or 'nac_bypass-setup.sh', the traffic will then flow through the rogue device which will be able to log into the network and smuggle network packets.
‚û§ Captive portal bypass technique
  - Hack the captive authentication portal used to control network access
‚û§ VOIP hopping and VLAN hopping techniques
‚û§ ...
```
```
2. Post-connect scenario => Network access is temporarily granted while NAC checks are ran against your laptop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ MAC address randomization technique
  - Change your MAC address automatically (e.g. every minute) with a script to obtain a new IP address prior getting blocked
    and keep accessing the network resources.
‚û§ ...
```

-----------------
#### STEP 2. RECONNAISSANCE üïµ
<i>The purpose of the reconnaissance phase is to gather as much as possible information about the targets (Windows domains and internal network). It includes Windows domain(s) enumeration, DNS enumeration, targeted network scans...</i>
```
1. Black-box penetration test (we start with no account)
--------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ On our laptop connected to the LAN or Wifi, we run commands like 'ipconfig /all', 'ip a' and 'nslookup' to identify:
   - the IP address range of the user network (our laptop IP address is part of it)
   - the IP address range of a production (server) network/VLAN (thanks to the IP address of the DNS server which is usually also the IP address of a Domain Controller)
‚û§ Network sniffing
‚û§ Reconnaissance using DNS queries (e.g. reverse IP lookup, DNS zone transfer) and the naming convention of the hostnames
   Examples:
   - Domain Controllers have often a hostname like 'pr<bla>dc1', 'dv<bla>ad2', 'usdc02', 'prodfrdc3', etc.
   - Web servers have often a hostname like 'prweb01', 'wwwserver02', 'win2k16iis03', 'devJBOSS04', etc.
   - Database servers have often a hostname like 'sqlsrv01', 'prdbserver02', 'prodorasrv08', 'devmongodb14', etc. 
   - Citrix servers have often a hostname like 'prctxsrv1', 'printctx02', 'citrixsrv02', etc.
‚û§ Targeted network scans (e.g. Nmap and NSE scripts)
```
```
2. Grey-box penetration test (we start with 1 low-privileged Windows account)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ AD and Windows domain information gathering (enumerate accounts, groups, computers, ACLs, password policies, GPOs, Kerberos delegation, ...)
‚û§ Numerous tools and scripts can be used to enumerate a Windows domain
   Examples:
   - Windows native DOS and Powershell commands (e.g. 'net' commands, PowerShell ActiveDirectory module)
   - Sysinternals tools (e.g. ADexplorer.exe)
   - PowerView framework / SharpView
   - Powershell scripts like ADrecon.ps1
   - SharpHound/RustHound + BloodHound
   - PingCastle
   - Purple Knight
   - ADCollector
   - ADFind
```

-----------------
#### STEP 3. GAINING ACCESS üîìüßëüèº‚Äçüíª
<i>The purpose of this phase is to gain (unauthorized) access to several internal systems (e.g. servers, file shares, databases) by exploiting common security issues such as: default/weak passwords, OS security misconfiguration, insecure network protocols and unpatched known vulnerabilities.</i>
```
1. Black-box penetration test (we start with no account)

‚û§ Windows password spray attacks (goal: find accounts protected by an easy guessable password or even a blank password / be careful not to lock accounts)
‚û§ Anonymous access to data storage spaces (e.g. FTP/TFTP/NFS) + Windows clear-text credentials hardcoded in scripts, logs and configuration files 
‚û§ Upload of malicious SCF or URL files to anonymously writable Windows network shares + collect NTLMv2 password hashes + Offline password cracking (tools: John, hashcat)
‚û§ Enumerate PXE boot media potentially provided from an SCCM server and then try to retrieve Windows credentials via PXE boot media (tools: pxethiefy, PXEthief)

‚û§ ...
```

---------------
#### STEP 4. POST-EXPLOITATION and LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION üõ†üßëüèº‚Äçüíª 
<i>The purpose of the post-exploitation phase is to determine the value of the systems compromised during the previous phase (e.g. sensitivity of the data stored on it, usefulness in further compromising the network) and to escalate privileges to harvest credentials (e.g. to steal the password of a privileged account from the memory of a Windows server/laptop). During this phase, the system(s) compromised can be set-up as a pivot to reach machines that are located in other networks. </i>

```
1. Windows local privilege escalation to become local administrator and/or "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Exploiting OS security misconfiguration 
   Examples:
   - weak service permissions (file & binpath)
   - service unquoted path
   - autorun and weak file permissions
   - privileged scheduled tasks and weak file permissions
   - weak registry permissions
   - dll hijacking
   - weak passwords and password re-use
   - clear-text passwords stored in scripts, unattended install files, configuration files (e.g. Web.config), ...
   - AlwaysInstallElevated trick
   - bring your own vulnerable driver
  
‚û§ Exploiting an unpatched local Windows vulnerability 
  (e.g. KrbrelayUp, LocalPotato, PrintNightmare, SeriousSam/HiveNightmare, Windows Installer LPE, Juicy/Rotten/Hot Potato exploits,...)

‚û§ Exploiting an unpatched vulnerability affecting a third party software running with high privileges
```
```
2. Dumping Windows credentials from memory and registry hives (requires local admin priv)

   - Dumping lsass with rundll32 and comsvcs.dll
   - Dumpert
   - SQLDumper (included with Microsoft SQL) 
   - ...
```
```
3. Dumping other credentials
----------------------------
   - The LaZagne application can be used to retrieve passwords stored in browsers, DBA tools (e.g. dbvis, SQLdevelopper) and Sysadmin tools (e.g. WinSCP, PuttyCM, OpenSSH, VNC, OpenVPN)
   - The script SessionGopher.ps1 can be used to find and decrypt saved session information for remote access tools (PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, RDP)
   - Dumping KeePass master password from memory using tools like 'Keethief', 'KeePassHax' or 'KeePwn'
   - Clear-text passwords hardcoded in scripts, configuration files (e.g. Web.config, tomcat-users.xml), backup files, log files, ...
```

-----------------
#### STEP 5. NETWORK LATERAL MOVEMENT and PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS HUNTING üï∏üßëüèº‚Äçüíª 
<i>The purpose of the lateral movement phase is to identify Windows servers and laptops on which high privileged user and service accounts are logged (e.g. administrator of all servers, administrator of all workstations/laptops, Domain Admin account). Then try to log into these Windows servers and laptops (for example by re-using the credentials harvested during the previous phase) and take over the high privileged accounts using various hacking techniques (e.g., dumping credentials from memory, token impersonation). </i>
```
1. Network lateral movement techniques 
--------------------------------------
‚û§ Use native Windows commands and protocols such as: RDP, PowerShell Remoting (WinRM), WMIC, PsExec, Windows built-in SSH client & server, etc.
‚û§ Use hacking tools such as: Evil-WinRM, NetExec, Impacket framework (e.g., WMIexec, SMBexec), etc.

‚û§ BloodHound
```
```
4. Take over privileged accounts (requires local admin priv)
------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Dump Windows credentials of privileged accounts from memory and registry hives + Pass-The-Hash technique
‚û§ Use Windows Token impersonation technique to execute arbirary OS commands as another privileged account (victim) also logged on the same Windows server
‚û§ RDP session hijacking technique (e.g., using the native Windows command "c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe")
‚û§ Add a malicious script or a malware in the Windows start-up folder of a server to force any privileged users (victims) to run it when they logon
  (e.g., "\\REMOTE-COMPUTER-NAME\C$\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\malware.exe")
‚û§ Create a malicious scheduled task that is triggered at log on of any user and that executes a malicious script with the victim user's privileges
‚û§ Modify the registry RUN keys so every time a user logs on the Windows server a malware or a malicious script is run with its privileges
‚û§ ...
```
-----------------
#### STEP 6. WINDOWS DOMAIN COMPROMISE (Privilege escalation to become "Domain Admin" + Persistence) üî•üßëüèº‚Äçüíª 
<i>The purpose of this phase is to take full control over the target Windows domain.</i>

```
1. Privilege escalation to become "Domain Admin"
------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Dumping from a Windows server's memory the clear-text password (or hash) of an account member of the group 'Domain Admins' or 'Administrators' of the Domain Controller
‚û§ Exploiting AD / Windows domain security misconfiguration
   Examples:
   - abusing weak ACL or GPO permissions
   - abusing LAPS misconfiguration
   - exploiting password reuse issues
     > the same password is used to protect multiple high privileged accounts and low-privileged accounts 
     > the same password is used to protect the default local administrator account of the Windows servers and the Domain Controllers (i.e. no hardening, no LAPS)
‚û§ Exploiting Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) misconfiguration
   Examples:
   - abusing misconfigured Certificate Templates - ESC1 & ESC2
   - abusing misconfigured Enrolment Agent Templates - ESC3

‚û§ Compromise an account member of the default security group 'Account Operators' that can be used to privesc and take over the Windows domain (known privesc)
‚û§ Find a backup/snapshot of a Windows Domain Controller on a NAS/FTP/Share and extract the password hashes (NTDS.DIT + SYSTEM) of high privileged acccounts (e.g. Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, krbtgt account)
‚û§ Abusing Microsoft Exchange for privilege escalation ('PrivExchange' vulnerability)
‚û§ Exploiting an unpatched vulnerability on a DC with a public exploit available (e.g. CVE-2020-1472  Zerologon, risky to run in a production environment)
‚û§ Hack the Hypervisor (e.g. vCenter) on which the Domain Controllers are running, then perform a snapshot of the DCs, copy/download their memory dump files (.vmsn & .vmem) and finally extract the password hashes of high privileged acccounts (e.g. Domain Admins, Administrators of DC, krbtgt account)
‚û§ Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation attack (+ Printer Bug or PetitPotam)

   - Secretsdump
   - NetExec
   - CrackMapExec (legacy)
   - Mimikatz (dcsync technique)
   - ...
‚û§ Crack (with John or Hashcat) the password hashes of all the Windows domain accounts
```
```
3. Creating persistence (examples)
----------------------------------
‚û§ Use the KRBTGT account‚Äôs password hash to forge of a Kerberos Golden ticket with Domain Administrator privileges
‚û§ Keep temporarily the password hash of a highly-privileged service account (e.g. Domain Admin) with a password set to never expire
‚û§ Modify temporarily the ACLs to allow an account that you control to perform DCsync attack
‚û§ Request a certificate (ADCS) for a highly-privileged account (e.g. Domain Admin) 
‚û§ Add temporarily an account in a default AD security group such as 'Domain Admins', 'BUILTIN\Administrators' or 'Account Operators' 
‚û§ ...
```
-----------------
#### STEP 7. FOREST ROOT DOMAIN COMPROMISE (Privilege escalation to become "Enterprise Admin") üî•üî•üßëüèº‚Äçüíª 
<i>The purpose of this phase is to take full control over the Forest root domain and all the other domains in the target network.</i>
```
‚û§ Forge a Kerberos Golden Ticket (TGT) with a 'SID History' for the Forest 'Enterprise Admins' group
‚û§ Forge an inter-realm trust ticket (cross-domain trust kerberos ticket) and then create TGS for the services LDAP/CIFS/HOST/... in the parent domain 
‚û§ Take over other Windows domains due to password re-use across domains for high privileged accounts
‚û§ Take over other Windows domains thanks to AD Forest Trusts and/or misconfiguration (e.g. the group 'Domain Admins' of the domain A is member of the group 'Domain Admins' of the domain B) 
‚û§ ...
```
-----------------
#### DEFENSE EVASION TECHNIQUES - BYPASSING ANTIVIRUS, EDR and SIEM SOLUTIONS
> During penetration tests, it is important to know how to bypass at least antivirus solutions to be able to identify and exploit vulnerabilities without being blocked.
> 
> In general, during Red Team exercises, in addition to assessing the security posture of a company by trying to achieve specific goals (e.g., becoming 'Domain Admin' of the Windows prod environment(s), getting unauthorized access to critical applications, "crown-jewel" data and email boxes of VIP/C-level employees, etc.), we also want to evaluate the effectiveness of the Security Operation Center (SOC) and its detection capabilities. Thus, it is important for red teamers to know how to be stealthy and bypass security detection solutions such as AV, EDR, SIEM, IDS/IPS, etc. 
For instance, in Red teaming, avoid at all costs using "noisy & easy to detect" hacking tools (e.g. Mimikatz, Metasploit C2) and techniques (e.g. aggressive and wide network port and vulnerability scans).
```
1. Common antivirus bypass techniques - With a low privilege account
--------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Use living-off-the-land and fileless techniques
  - Download & execute malicious PowerShell scripts (with AMSI bypass), PE files and shellcodes directly into memory such as encrypted/obfuscated C2 agents (e.g. Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Metasploit, Havoc)
  - Use 'Living Off The Land' binaries, scripts and libraries (https://lolbas-project.github.io) to perform arbitrary code execution, file operations, UAC bypass, persistence, ...
‚û§ Regularly obfuscate and recompile your favorite (open source) hacking tools and scripts
‚û§ Write your own hacking tools and scripts
‚û§ Use PE/Dll packers and shellcode loaders that implement defense evasion techniques such as:
  - Code obfuscation & payload encryption
  - AMSI & ETW bypass
  - Anti-Debugging techniques
  - Sandbox evasion techniques
‚û§ Abuse potential AV exclusions set for files, folders, processes, and process-opened files
‚û§ Use portable legitimate SysAdmin tools and native OS commands/binaries which are less likely to be blocked by AV solutions than hacking tools
  For examples:
  - Portable SysAdmin tools: putty & plink, sysinternals tools, teamviewer, anydesk, mobaxterm, dbvisualizer, ...
  - Native OS commands/binaries: REG SAVE to extract the registry keys, WinRM for lateral movement, TSCON for RDP session hijacking, ...
‚û§ If you can read the Bitlocker recovery key of your Windows laptop in Microsoft Intune (or in the AD) then you can use it to decrypt your laptop's hard drive and delete the AV files
‚û§ ...
```
```
2. Common antivirus bypass techniques - With local admin privileges
-------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ All the AV bypass techniques listed in the previous section
‚û§ Kill the anti-malware (AV) protected processes using "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) techniques
‚û§ Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation on a compromised Windows laptop/workstation and run hacking tools and scripts inside a VM to avoid detection
‚û§ If the AV configuration panel is not password protected on a Windows computer, very often you can use local admin rights to:
  - Disable or downgrade the AV protection
  - Set new AV exclusions for your hacking tools, etc.
‚û§ If the AV anti-tampering protections are disabled on a Windows computer, very often you can use local admin rights to:
  - Modify the registry keys or rename the AV executable files and then restart it to disable the AV software
  - Suspend the AV processes with PsSuspend (sysinternals)
  - Uninstall the AV software
‚û§ ...
```
```
3. Common Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) bypass techniques - With a low privilege account
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Use as much as possible the Sysadmin tools already installed on the compromised systems to "blend in" among the legitimate system administrators
‚û§ Abuse potential EDR exclusions (whitelist) set for files, folders, processes, and process-opened files
‚û§ Find server(s) in the network that have not been yet onboarded in the EDR solution & use them as a pivot (e.g. obfuscated/encrypted C2 implant + socks proxy)
‚û§ Write your own hacking tools/exploits when possible or carefully modify, obfuscate and test open-source ones before using them
‚û§ Use living-off-the-land and fileless techniques
‚û§ Use PE/Dll packers and shellcode loaders that implement defense evasion techniques such as:
  - Code obfuscation & payload encryption
  - AMSI & ETW bypass
  - Anti-Debugging techniques
  - Sandbox evasion techniques
  - Import Address Table (IAT) obfuscation
  - NTDLL unhooking techniques
  - use of direct syscalls
  - use of indirect syscalls
  - module stomping technique
  - suspended process method
  - ...
‚û§ If you can read the Bitlocker recovery key of your Windows laptop in Microsoft Intune (or in the AD) then you can use it to decrypt your laptop's hard drive and delete the EDR files
‚û§ ...
```
```
4. Common Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) bypass techniques - With local admin privileges
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ All the EDR bypass techniques listed in the previous section
‚û§ Kill the anti-malware (EDR) protected processes using "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) techniques
‚û§ Disable or uninstall the EDR agent if it is not protected by a password
‚û§ Add a rule in the local Windows firewall that will prevent the EDR agent to send alerts to the EDR appliance/server
‚û§ Add a wrong IP address for the EDR appliance/server in the '/etc/hosts' file to prevent the EDR agent to send alerts to the EDR appliance/server
‚û§ Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation on a compromised Windows laptop/workstation and run hacking tools and scripts inside a VM to avoid detection
‚û§ Modify the registry keys or rename the EDR executable files on a compromised Windows machine and then restart it to disable the EDR software
‚û§ ...
```
```
5. Common techniques to bypass SIEM detection use cases / rules (e.g., YARA/SIGMA rules, audit trail based detections)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚û§ Use Windows/Linux OS command-line obfuscation techniques
‚û§ Use in priority less-known tools and command aliases
‚û§ Avoid using "one-liner" commands that are easier to catch in event log files
‚û§ Copy and rename Windows/Linux native binaries before using them is sometimes sufficient to bypass basic detection
