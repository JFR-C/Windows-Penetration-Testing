Abusing non-SSL WSUS traffic with wsuxploit
============================================================================================================

=> Source: https://github.com/pimps/wsuxploit

This is a MiTM weaponized exploit script to inject 'fake' updates into non-SSL WSUS traffic. 
It is based on the WSUSpect Proxy application that was introduced to public on the Black Hat USA 2015 presentation, 'WSUSpect â€“ Compromising the Windows Enterprise via Windows Update'.


Scenario
----------
During an internal penetration test, you discover that the WSUS server address of your target network (workstations & servers) uses the HTTP protocol. 
As a result you can impersonate the WSUS server using a MITM attack and get SYSTEM access to the windows targets inside of the internal (that you can 
affect with your MITM attack).


Step 1 -  You have gain access to a workstation or server and you verify the configuration of WSUS
